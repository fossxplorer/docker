# Minimal and lean Docker images for ARM/aarch64/arm64v8
The Docker images here are adhering (or least trying to) to the following rules:
- keep the images as lean and small as possible
- use Alpine arm64v8 as the base image
- enable logging to sentral logging infrastructure by logging separate files, i.e no logging to stderr


The Docker images will be continuously improved and suggestions are welcome!

For now there will be arm64v8 Docker images for:
- Bind
- Nginx
- PHP-FPM.

On the todo list is:
- MariaDB
- Nextcloud. 


 Any questions? File a bug then ;-)
