# Minimal and lean Docker images for different purposes
The Docker images here are adhering (or least trying to) to the following rules:
- keep the images as small as possible
- use Alpine as the base image
- enable logging to sentral logging infrastructure by logging separate files, i.e no logging to stderr


# The Docker images will be continuously improved and suggestions are welcome!

For now there will be images for Bind, Nginx and PHP-FPM. On the todo list is MariaDB in the near future and Nextcloud. 


# Any questions? File a bug then ;-)
